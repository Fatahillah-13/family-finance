## 2026-02-03 - Accessible Tabs for Transactions
**Learning:** Custom UI components like tabs often lack the necessary ARIA roles (tablist, tab, tabpanel) and states (aria-selected, aria-controls), making them difficult for screen reader users to navigate. Adding these attributes, along with visual distinction (e.g., using brand colors instead of generic grays), significantly improves both accessibility and user delight.
**Action:** Always check custom selection components for ARIA compliance and ensure the active state has sufficient visual contrast.
